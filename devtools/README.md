# Documentation: generate_docs.py

The script `generate_docs.py` generates a modern, responsive HTML documentation page from the `README.md` in the project root. The generated file is saved as `docs/index.html` and can be published directly with GitHub Pages.

## How it works
- Reads the `README.md` from the project root.
- Converts the Markdown content to HTML and embeds it in a responsive layout with header, footer, and container.
- Includes the stylesheet `docs/assets/css/style.css`.
- Adjusts image paths so they work both on GitHub and on the website (`assets/screenshots/`).
- The footer automatically contains a link to the releases of the current GitHub repository.
- The page title is taken from the first heading in the README or defaults to "Page".

## Usage
You can run the script directly:

```bash
python devtools/generate_docs.py
```

The generated `docs/index.html` is optimized for GitHub Pages and reflects all changes from the `README.md`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `markdown` package (see `requirements.txt`)

## Notes
- Images must be placed in the `assets/screenshots/` folder to be displayed correctly everywhere.
- The README.md uses the same image paths as the generated website.
